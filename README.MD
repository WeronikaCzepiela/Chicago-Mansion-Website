## Description

The website mainly consists of three tabs - home, about, and contact. The first one is the target one that is displayed when the page is opened. Switching between tabs is possible by clicking on the appropriate text in the header. However, if the page is displayed on a phone, the burger menu icon is displayed. Then use it to navigate the page.
The tab in which the user is currently located is always underlined in the header.
In the 'Contact' tab you can send an e-mail with an inquiry. Sent e-mails go to the author's e-mail box.
At the bottom of the page, some icons serve to redirect the user to the social media page.
